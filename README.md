# Control Flow in Dart

This repository demonstrates basic control flow concepts in Dart programming language through practical examples.

## Examples

### 1. Even/Odd Number Categorization
File: `even_odd.dart`

This program demonstrates:
- Using a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers
- Implementing switch case for number categorization
- Handling both positive and negative numbers

Features:
- Takes a list of integers (positive, negative, and zero)
- Uses modulo operator (%) to determine even/odd status
- Prints categorization results for each number

### 2. Positive/Negative and Even/Odd Checker
File: `positive_negative.dart`

This program demonstrates:
- Conditional statements (if-else) for number classification
- Multiple condition checking
- Single number evaluation

Features:
- Determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero
- Checks if the number is even or odd
- Prints both classification results

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Dart SDK installed on your system
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the examples using:
   ```bash
   dart run even_odd.dart
   dart run positive_negative.dart
   ```
